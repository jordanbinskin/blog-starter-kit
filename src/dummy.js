First, there are two types of variables (or bindings) those which you have declared, and those which you have not. The next thing you can do after you declare a variable, is assign it a value. You can shortcut declaring a variable and go straight to its assignment. This is highly unrecommended, without much nuance to argue the other way i.e. don't pollute the global scope. Note in strict mode this will throw a ReferenceError."
